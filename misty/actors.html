    <h1>Actors</h1>
<p>Misty has direct support for <b>actors</b>. Actors run independently and concurrently. Actors communicate by sending messages. Every actor has its own memory space. Actors do not share memory. A program is generally a lead actor that may be supported by a team of supporting actors running in the same machine or in different machines. An actor may make use of modules.</p>

    <code>"actor"</code>
    <code>"module"</code>
</p>
<p>Every actor has an actor object called <code>@</code><small>at sign</small> that contains a reference to the actor itself and other powerful capabilities. An actor can pass actor objects (including an attenuated version of <code>@</code>)  as parameters to functions or in  messages to other actors. If an actor can acquire the actor object of another actor, then it can send messages to it. Messages may contain numbers, texts, records, arrays, logicals, <code>null</code>, blobs, and actor objects. </p>
<p>An attenuated <code>@</code> object is produced when <code>@</code> is on the right side of a <a href="statements.html#set"><code>set</code></a> statement, or when <code>@</code> is passed an argument to a function, or when <code>@</code> is included in an array literal or record literal.</p>
<p>Misty programs are organized into source files. There are two types of Misty source files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>module</li>
  <li>actor</li>
</ul>
<p>A module  is a chunk of independent program. These can be used to build reusable libraries. The last statement in a module is a <a href="statements.html#return"><code>return</code></a> statement, which usually returns a function or a record containing functions. That return value is bound to the name in a <code>use</code> statement.</p>
<p> An actor file includes the word <code>actor</code> before the name.</p>
<p>In this example, the <code>example</code> actor  imports the <code>app_master_2000</code>  module, and designates its <code>handler</code> function as the receiver of messages for the actor.</p>
<pre>misty actor example {
    use app: &quot;app_master_2000&quot;
    call @.receiver(app.handler)
}</pre>
<p>Actors are started with the <code>@.new</code> method. An actor that starts another actor is called a <b id="master">master</b>. An actor started by a master is called a <b id="padawan">padawan</b>. An actor can be a padawan to one actor and a master to many others.</p>
<p>Communication between actors happens exclusively with messages.
Messages are one-way with eventual consequences. </p>
<p>Messages are usually transmitted over some sort of connection. </p>
<h3 id="use"><code>use</code> statement</h3>
<p class="rule">

    <code>""</code>
    <code>"use"</code> space name locator linebreak use
</p>
<p class="rule">
locator
    <code>""</code>
    <code>": "</code> text_literal 
    <code>": "</code> name
</p>
<p>The <code>use</code> statement makes a module available to an actor or another module. The return value of the module is bound to the <dfn>name</dfn>. An optional <dfn>locator</dfn> can be provided for finding the module file. Standard modules do not require a locator.</p>
<h2>Actor object</h2>
<p>An actor object contains the information needed to communicate with an actor.
An actor object can be transmitted to other actors, even on other machines.</p>
<p>An actor object is an immutable black box. It can be used in a <a href="statements.html#send"><code>send</code> statement</a> to send a message to the actor associated with the actor object. Actor objects can be sent to other actors, giving them the capability to also send messages to the actor associated with the actor object. </p>
<p>None of the contents of the actor object are visible or accessible. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
actor?(@)                     # true
actor?(my_actor)              # true
record?(my_actor)             # false
stone?(my_actor)              # true
my_actor = my_actor           # true
my_actor = your_actor         # false (probably)</pre>
<h2> The <code>actor?</code> function</h2>
<h4>actor?(<var>value</var>)</h4>
<p>The <code> actor?</code> function gives <code>true</code> if the <var>value</var> is an actor object.</p>
<h2 id="messages">Messages</h2>
<p>Actors communicate using messages. Actors do not share variables or functions.</p>
<p>Incoming messages are queued by the Misty system and delivered in arrival order. The  exceptions are system level messages like the <code>die</code> message, which, if valid, will cause an actor to immediately fail, even if there are undelivered messages waiting for it in the queue. </p>
<p>Some messages can be used to reply to the original sender of the message.</p>
<h3>receiver function</h3>
<p>The <code>receiver</code> method is given a callback function that will receive the actor's messages. The callback function will receive a single argument, the message object. The callback function will not be given reply messages,
</p>
<h3>System Messages</h3>
<p>The Misty System uses its own messaging system to transmit system messages. A system message type has <code>℠</code> as its first character. Reserved  <code>℠</code> messages can not be sent by the <code>send</code> statement. </p>
<h4>℠begin</h4>
<p>The <code>begin</code> message is the first message sent to an actor when it is created. It will contain the actor object of the master. </p>
<h4>℠end</h4>
<p>The <code>end</code> message is sent when an actor is no longer needed. The actor receiving this message should finish its work and <code>die</code>.</p>
<h4>℠die</h4>
<p>The <code>die</code> message is not queued or delivered to the actor. Instead, the actor is immediately terminated. It will also terminate the <a href="#padawan">padawans</a> and pact actors. The <code>die</code> message can only be sent by the <code>die</code> method or as a consequence of a pact.</p>
<h4>℠done</h4>
<p>The <code>done</code> message is sent to the master of an actor if an actor stops for any reason.</p>
<h4>℠hello</h4>
<p>The <code>hello</code> message is sent as a response to the <code>contact</code> method. It will include the actor object of the remote actor.</p>
<h4>℠pact</h4>
<p>The <code>pact</code> message is a request to be sent a <code>die</code> message when the receiver dies.</p>
<h2><code>@</code> Methods</h2>
<p>The <code>@</code> object is only available in the <code>misty</code> <code>actor</code> files. The <code>@</code> object is not available in <code>misty</code> <code>module</code> files, although the attenuated actor object and some of the <code>@</code> methods can be passed in. The <code>@</code> object may contain these methods: <code>new</code>, <code>connection</code>, <code>contact</code>, <code>receiver</code>, <code>portal</code>, <code>kill</code>, <code>pact</code>, <code>delay</code>, <code>clock</code>, <code>random</code>.</p>
<h3><code>new</code> method</h3>
<h4 id="nex">@.new(<var>callback</var>, <var>text</var>, <var>configuration</var>)</h4>
<p>The <code>new</code> function creates a new actor. It takes a <var>text</var> that identifies the actor program file  that the new actor  runs. It sends the <code>℠begin</code> message to the new actor.  </p>
<p>The <var>configuration</var>  record  contains fields having the names of the <code>@</code> methods. If the field's value is <code>true</code>, then the new actor will have that method in its own <code>@</code> object. So, if the configuration contains  a <code>contact</code> field that is <code>true</code>, then the new actor is allowed to contact portals to obtain actor objects. </p>
<p>The <var>callback</var> is passed the new actor object.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>call @.new(
    callback
    &quot;example.mst&quot;
    {
        contact: true
        new: true
        pact: true
        receiver: true
    }
)</pre>
<h3 id="connection"><code>connection</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.connection(<var>callback</var>, <var>actor</var>, <var>configuration</var>) </h4>
<p>The <code><strong>connection</strong></code> method takes a <var>callback</var> function, an <var>actor</var> object, and a <var>configuration</var> record for getting information about the status of a  connection to an actor.  The configuration record is used to request the sort of information that needs to be communicated. This can include partitions, speed, congestion, cost, activity. The <var>callback</var> will be given a record containing the requested information.</p>
<h3 id="contact"><code>contact</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.contact(<var>callback</var>, <var>record</var>) </h4>
<p>The <code>contact</code> method sends a message to a portal on another machine to obtain an actor object.</p>
<p>The <var>record</var> can contain:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coordinates
        <ul>
            <li>Network address</li>
            <li>Port number</li>
        </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Authentication
        <ul>
            <li>Public Key</li>
            <li>Identifier</li>
            <li>Shared secret</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Specification
        <ul>
            <li>Service name</li>
            <li>Feature request</li>
            <li>Actor identifier</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The current actor is the parent of the new actor, and it will be notified when the new actor terminates.</p>
<p>The <var>callback</var> function will be passed the <a href="#padawan">padawan</a> actor object.</p>
<h3 id="receiver"><code>receiver</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.receiver(<var>function</var>)<br>
</h4>
<p>This method registers a <var>function</var> that will receive all messages sent to the actor except for portal contact messages, and replies. </p>
<h3 id="portal"><code>portal</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.portal(<var>function</var>, <var>port</var>)
</h4>
<p>A portal  is a special actor that that performs introduction services. It listens on a specified <var>port</var> for  contacts by external actors that need to acquire an actor object. The function will receive the record containing the request. The record can have a reply sent through it. A portal can respond by beginning a new actor, or finding an existing actor, or by forwarding the contact message to another actor. This is how distributed Misty networks are bootstrapped.</p>
<h3 id="kill"><code>kill</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.kill(<var>actor</var>)
</h4>
<p>This method sends the <code>die</code> message. The <var>actor</var> object must be one of your own novices or <code>@</code>. An actor may kill itself.</p>
<h3 id="pact"><code>pact</code> method</h3>
<h4>@.pact(<var>actor object</var>, <var>another actor object</var>)</h4>
<p>The pact function links two actors together in a suicide pact. If the <var>other actor object</var> fails, then <var>actor object</var> will fail. The <var>actor object</var> must be either <code>@</code> or one of its <a href="#padawan">padawans</a>.</p>
<p>If a master  fails, then all of its <a href="#padawan">padawans</a> fail automatically.</p>
<h3><code>delay</code> method</h3>
<h4 id="delay"><code>@.delay(</code><var>function</var><code>,</code> <var>seconds</var><code>)</code></h4>
<p>The <code>delay</code> function is used to schedule the invocation of a <var>function</var> at a later time. Any value returned
    from the delayed invocation will be ignored. There is no guarantee that the <var>function</var> will ever be invoked. The delayed invocation will not interrupt
    normal processing. The invocation will be delayed until the system is
    quiescent.</p>
<p>The <code>delay</code> function immediately returns a <code>cancel</code> function. Calling the <code>cancel</code> function will cancel the delayed execution of the function, if it is not too late.</p>
<p>The <var>seconds</var> parameter determines when the invocation will occur,
    no sooner than <var>seconds</var> seconds after now. The <var>seconds</var> parameter must be a non-negative number or <code>null</code> which behaves as 0.</p>
<h3 id="clock"><code>clock</code> method</h3>
<h4><code>@.clock(<var>function</var>)</code></h4>
<p>The <code>clock</code> method takes a <var>function</var> argument that will eventually be called with  the current time
in number form.  See <a href="time.html">time</a>.</p>
<h3 id="random">random function</h3>
<h4>@.random()</h4>
<p>The <code>random</code> function returns a number between 0 and 1.</p>
<h2>Actor Data Structures</h2>
<h3>Actor Object</h3>
<p>An actor object is used with the <code><a href="statements.html#send">send</a></code> statement. It contains the address of an actor. A message may contain actor objects, which will give the recipient actor the capability to send to those actors.</a></p>
<p>There are three ways that an actor can obtain an actor object of another actor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>by creating an actor with <code>@.new</code></li>
    <li>by contacting an actor with <code>@.contact</code></li>
    <li>by receiving a message containing an actor object</li>
</ul>
<h3>Message object</h3>
<p>A message object is obtained from the callback function that is registered with <code>@.receiver</code>. It acts like an ordinary record. </p>
<p>When a message is sent using the callback form, the message may be used as an actor object for transmitting the reply.</p>
<h2 id="turns">Turns</h2>
<p>Computation takes place in an actor in a fragment of time called a <dfn>turn</dfn>.
A turn starts with the delivery of a message.
A function (such as the function registered with <code>@.receive</code>, <code>@.portal</code>, <code>@.clock</code>,  or a <code>@.delay</code> callback function) will run to completion or failure. Any outgoing messages will be held until the turn completes successfully, at which time they go into the outgoing queue and are sent.</p>
<p>An actor will not receive another message until the turn ends. Each turn will process exactly one message.</p>
<p>If a machine has multiple computation units, then it is possible for multiple turns of multiple actors to be going on simultaneously.
Turns can be timesliced. There are no concurrency issues because actors do not share memory.
They communicate with other actors and the world only by  message passing. </p>
