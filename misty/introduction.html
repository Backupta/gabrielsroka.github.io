    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p align="left">Public Domain 2023 Douglas Crockford</p>
<p>The Misty Programming Language is a dynamic, general-purpose, transitional, actor
  language. It has a gentle syntax that is intended to benefit students, as well
  as advanced features such as capability security and lambdas with lexical scoping. </p>
<p>The grammar of the language is expressed in <a href="http://www.crockford.com/mckeeman.html">McKeeman Form</a>.</p>
<h2>Space</h2>
<p>The language is quite strict in its use of spaces and indentation.
In most programming languages, code spacing and formatting are underspecified, which leads to many incompatible conventions of style,
some promoting bug formation, and all promoting time-wasting arguments, incompatibilities, and hurt feelings.
Misty instead allows only one convention which is strictly enforced.
This  liberates programmers to focus their attention on more important matters.</p>
<p>Indentation is in increments of 4 spaces. The <dfn>increment</dfn> increases when the last token
    on a line is <code>'('</code>, <code>'{'</code>, or <code>'['</code>, and decreases just
before the matching <code>')'</code>, <code>'}'</code>, <code>']'</code>. The McKeeman Form is extended by three special rules to make this possible:</p>
<dl>
<dt>indentation</dt><dd>The spaces required by the current nesting.</dd>
<dt>increase_indentation</dt>
<dd>Append four spaces to the indentation.</dd>
<dt>decrease_indentation</dt>
<dd>Remove four spaces from the indentation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <dfn>indent</dfn> rule adds four spaces to the <dfn>indentation</dfn> and ends the line. The <dfn>outdent</dfn> rule removes four spaces from the <dfn>indentation</dfn> and ends the line.</p>
<p class="rule">
indent
    increase_indentation linebreak
</p>
<p class="rule">
outdent
    decrease_indentation linebreak
</p>
<p id=linebreak>The <dfn>linebreak</dfn> rule allows the insertion of a comment, ends the line,
and checks the indentation of the next line. Multiple comments and blank lines
may appear wherever a line can end.</p>
<p class="rule">
linebreak
    trailing_comment linefeeds comments indentation
</p>
<p class="rule">
linefeeds
    linefeed linefeeds
    linefeed
</p>
<p class="rule">
linefeed
    <code>'000A'</code>
</p>
<p>There are many places where the language expects an end of line, such as at the end of a statement.</p>
<p>Misty is strict about whitespace in order to eliminate the need for, debate over, and circumvention of coding standards. Misty starts with the pretty convention of <a href="json.html">JSON</a> formatting. For example, JSON allows this compact JSON text</p>
<pre>{&quot;one&quot;:1,&quot;array&quot;:[1,2,3],&quot;text&quot;:&quot;hello&quot;}</pre>
<p>to be presented more pleasingly as</p>
<pre>{
    &quot;one&quot;: 1,
    &quot;array&quot;: [
        1,
        2,
        3
    ],
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;
}</pre>
<p>Misty takes this further by eliminating the comma  at the end of a line, and eliminating quotes on field names in most cases.</p>
<pre>{
    one: 1
    array: [
        1
        2
        3
    ]
    text: &quot;hello&quot;
}</pre>
<p>Misty uses the same convention with <code>(</code><small>left paren</small> and <code>)</code><small>right paren</small> in argument lists and expressions. In an open argument list, each argument goes on its own line and the commas between the arguments are eliminated.</p>
<pre>my_button.on(
    "click"
    &#402; (event) {
        call event.done()
        call take_action()
    }
)</pre>
<p>In complex expressions, parens can allow a line break.</p>
<pre>def atan: &#402; (slope) (
    sine(
        slope / (math.sqrt(slope * slope) + 1)
    )
)

set progress: (
    result 
    + (radicand / result)
) / 2
</pre>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>A comment begins with an <code>#</code><small>octothrope</small> and ends with the end of the line.
Comments are used to provide context and motivation to help humans understand the programming.
The Misty System strictly ignores all comments.</p>
<p class="rule">
trailing_comment
    <code>""</code>
    comment
</p>
<p class="rule">
comments
    <code>""</code>
    comment linefeeds comments
</p>
<p class="rule">
comment
    spaces <code>'#'</code> comchars
</p>
<p class="rule">
spaces
    <code>""</code>
    space spaces
</p>
<p class="rule">
space
    <code>' '</code>
</p>
<p class="rule">
comchars
    <code>""</code>
    comchar comchars
</p>
<p class="rule">
comchar
    <code>'0020'</code> . <code>'10FFFF'</code>
</p>

<h2>Names</h2>
<p>Names are used to identify fields, variables, modules, actors, and parameters.
Names are made of letters.
A name must be longer than one letter.
Names may contain <code>_</code><small>underbar</small> to improve intelligibility.
CamelCase is not allowed.
Names may end with <code>?</code><small>question mark</small> which is used to indicate predicates and truth values.</p>
<p class="rule">
name
    upper upper name_upper question
    upper lower name_lower question
    upper <code>'_'</code> name_part question
    lower lower name_lower question
    lower <code>'_'</code> name_part question
</p>
<p class="rule">
name_part
    upper name_upper
    lower name_lower
</p>
<p class="rule">
name_upper
    upper name_upper
    name_lower
</p>
<p class="rule">
name_lower
    <code>""</code>
    <code>'_'</code> name_part
    lower name_lower
</p>
<p class="rule">
upper
    <code>'A'</code> . <code>'Z'</code>
</p>
<p class="rule">
lower
    <code>'a'</code> . <code>'z'</code>
</p>
<p class="rule">

    <code>""</code>
    <code>'?'</code>
</p>
There are no reserved words.
